        <p>
         - I believe that technology can transform education, business, and daily life in East Africa and around the world.
          With the right training and access, young people can build solutions that help their communities grow and succeed.
        </p>

         - I see Computer Science as more than just coding. It is about <strong>thinking logically</strong>,
          <strong>solving problems</strong>, and <strong>creating tools</strong> that make life better for others.
